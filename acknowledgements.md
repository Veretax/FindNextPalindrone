I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge all of the math teachers, CS professors, teachers, and people that love to use 
interesting properties of numbers like palindromes to help teach and spread the fun that is coding.

I dedicate this sample to Shanna, the one who inspired me to write this bit of code and release it into the public domain

This software is meant as a working sample, feel free to use any bits of it if you are looking for an approach, but
I hope that if you are looking at this work for achieving a grade in a course, that you do not copy it verbatim, for your 
own sake.
